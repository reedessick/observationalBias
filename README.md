# observationalBias

A module that computes and plots the expected observational bias for ground-based detectors. This should work well for the LHO-LLO network, but may need more careful validation for other detector networks (because of some assumptions about projecting into detector planes). However, the formalism is based off the bayesburst code and separate PSD estimation (form another of my git repos) and I believe it to be robust.
